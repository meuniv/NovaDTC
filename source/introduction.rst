Welcome to Designed to Crunch
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Nova award is designed to help you explore how math affects your life each day.

The site is organized per requirement. To succesfully complete the requirements, the scout will get in touch with an approved Nova Counselor and give proofs of completion.

Before you start anything, make sure you identify a counselor and read carefully the section below on how to complete and document your progress!

Documenting your progress
-------------------------

A template worksheet can be found `here <bdbdbd>`_. This is a *Google document*. You will not be able to modify it until you make your own copy as I will now describe for you.


If you have any question
------------------------

Contact your counselor or your scoutmaster! If you have questions about the program, contact Dr. Meunier  by `email <mailto:vinmeunier@gmail.com>`_.
